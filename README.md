# CS:GO Crosshair

_The crosshair that I use in CS:GO. Published here for convenience when accessing from LAN shops etc. Modified from [this crosshair](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1ugdm1/post_your_crosshair_configs_with_screenshots/cehwy7m/)._

### As single line (to paste in console)
`cl_crosshairalpha "150"; cl_crosshairdot "0"; cl_crosshairgap "-100"; cl_crosshairsize "500"; cl_crosshairstyle "2"; cl_crosshairusealpha "1"; cl_crosshairthickness "0.4"; cl_fixedcrosshairgap "-100"; cl_crosshair_drawoutline "0";`

### Expanded
```
cl_crosshairalpha "150"
cl_crosshairdot "0"
cl_crosshairgap "-100"
cl_crosshairsize "500"
cl_crosshairstyle "2"
cl_crosshairusealpha "1"
cl_crosshairthickness "0.4"
cl_fixedcrosshairgap "-100"
cl_crosshair_drawoutline "0"
```


### Features

  - High visibility
  - Extremely thin and does not obscure targets
  - Long horizontal line enables easier "flick" aims
  - Long vertical line makes predicting / shooting through smoke much easier
